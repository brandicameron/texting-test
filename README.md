### Did a pre-teen in your family just get their first cell phone?

Make them pass a text etiquette test (customized with your name) before they're awarded your phone number... don't worry, there's no way to fail the test. üëç

### Why does this exsist??

Welcome to my first "real" personal coding project using a little javascript! In the last year of learning to code, I've followed along with a lot of tutorial projects and made a few code snippets, but never created my very own finished thing. 

When I learned my 10 year old nephew was getting a cell phone, I realized that I needed to take action to avoid the inevitable influx of fart and video game themed texts I was about to receive. Enter the PERFECT opportunity to flex some coding muscle. üòà
